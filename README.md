# 65816-breadboard-computer
My Personal 65C816 breadboard build, including schematics, etc.


/EEPROM Programmer contains a micropython eeprom programming dealio, which requires 2 595 Shift registers and either a 5v logic microcontroller (Arduino) or a bidirectional level shifter for a 3.3v microcontroller.

/KiCad contains my schematics/raw kicad files, if you want to laugh at my design.

/Programs contains the programs I've written, probably mostly raw assembly, idk if i will implement c

## Known Issues:
everything is broken atm :) I think it's hardware fuckups on my end, but I have to get my ROM working properly before i can test.
idk if my programmer is broken on a hardware or software level, so that's my current troubleshooting situation.
